# Heap
## Intro
### Two Types of Heap
- Min heap
- Max heap
### Binary Heap
- heap made out of complete binary tree
- the benefit of this is we can store the heap in a single array without wasting any extra space
- and every element is stored continuously, so locality of reference(locality of reference)
- and it's height is minimum possible
